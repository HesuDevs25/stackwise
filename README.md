#Block configurations

Block - A designated area within the yard, often labeled (e.g.A1, B2, etc.).       
Bay - The horizontal position along the length of the block (e.g., front to back).
Row - The horizontal position across the width (side to side).                   
Tier - The vertical stacking level (1st container on the ground = Tier 1).         
Slot -  The unique space that results from the intersection of a bay and row.        |

##Stacking order guidelines
Start placing containers from Tier 1 in Bay 1, Row 1, then move across the rows, then the bays, and only then go upward to Tier 2 when all Tier 1 slots are filled.The maximum Tier is 4
1.Start at the lowest tier (Tier 1 = ground level)
2.Fill across rows (left to right or east to west)
3.Then move to the next bay (front to back or south to north)
4.Only stack vertically (increase Tier) when ground slots are full
